        question: "Do I have to use the registry?",
        answer: `No, you can easily skip this step if you’d like. However, we always recommend you mark at
        least one item, even if it’s just a favorite charity. People like to show their support in one
        way or another – it might as well be something helpful to you or meaningful to your loved
        one.`

        question: "What happens if donations aren’t enough to cover the price of my registry item?",
        answer: `If donations don’t fully cover the price of something you selected, you can still choose to
        purchase the item by paying the remaining balance. You will have this option until you mark
        the item “No longer interested.” When an item is marked “No longer interested,” any donated
        money is refunded back to the donors. These donors then have the option to re-donate their
        funds to another item you have selected in the registry, if they choose to do so.`

        id: 3,
        question: "Can I use donated money toward a different item in the registry?",
        answer: `Creators cannot transfer donated funds from one registry item toward another registry item.
        Funds must either be used toward the item specified or refunded to the contributor.`
    },
    {
        id: 4,
        question: "How many items can I select for my registry?",
        answer: `There is no limit on the number of items you can select for your registry. However, the fewer
        you select, the greater your chance of items being fully funded by donations, so we
        recommend selecting fewer items that have the most meaning to you.`
