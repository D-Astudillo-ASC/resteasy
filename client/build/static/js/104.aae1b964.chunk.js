However, we always recommend you mark at\n        least one item, even if it\u2019s just a favorite charity. People like to show their support in one\n        way or another \u2013 it might as well be something helpful to you or meaningful to your loved\n        one."},{id:2,question:"What happens if donations aren\u2019t enough to cover the price of my registry item?",answer:"If donations don\u2019t fully cover the price of something you selected, you can still choose to\n        purchase the item by paying the remaining balance. You will have this option until you mark\n        the item \u201cNo longer interested.\u201d When an item is marked \u201cNo longer interested,\u201d any donated\n        money is refunded back to the donors. These donors then have the option to re-donate their\n        funds to another item you have selected in the registry, if they choose to do so."},{id:3,question:"Can I use donated money toward a different item in the registry?",answer:"Creators cannot transfer donated funds from one registry item toward another registry item.\n        Funds must either be used toward the item specified or refunded to the contributor."},{id:4,question:"How many items can I select for my registry?",answer:"There is no limit on the number of items you can select for your registry. However, the fewer\n        you select, the greater your chance of items being fully funded by donations, so we\n        recommend selecting fewer items that have the most meaning to you."}]}}]);
