In times of grieving, we try to make things a little easier. \n        \n        RestEasy provides those who have recently lost loved ones with a meaningful and \n        personalized way to commemorate them. Our Digital Memory product lets you create and \n        customize a digital memorial with photos, videos, articles, music, and memories that \n        celebrate the life of your loved one. Publish and share with family and friends so they can \n        contribute additional memories. \n\n        Our Registry feature allows you to register for items that would help you cope with the \n        grief and memorialize your loved one \u2013 in the way they would want to be remembered. \n        Registry items can include products, services, or charitable organizations listed on our site, \n        and if you don\u2019t see what you\u2019re looking for, you can create your own custom cash fund. \n        Those with whom you share the Memory can donate funds to help you attain your registry \n        items."},{id:2,question:"What makes RestEasy different?",answer:"Traditionally, condolence messages are captured in a Funeral Guest Book at a funeral service. \n        The book can only be signed by those who physically attend the funeral and can only be read by the \n        person who keeps it after the service. \n\n        A Digital Memory allows everyone who loved your loved one to contribute not only stories and messages, \n        but photos, live videos, and music. And it can be viewed at any time (birthdays, anniversaries, any \n        Tuesday when you really miss them) by all who love them.\n        \n        Sharing your Digital Memory allows you to move outside the confines of a traditional obituary when \n        announcing a death. Share more than just facts about their life and death - capture the essence of \n        who they are and the legacy they have left."},{id:3,question:"How much does it cost?",answer:"$20 for creators. Free for contributors. \n\n        A one-time creation fee of $20 allows you to create, customize, publish, share, and cherish \n        your loved one\u2019s Digital Memory forever. \n\n        Sharing a memory or contributing funds to an existing Digital Memory is free."},{id:4,question:"How does it work?",answer:"Create a Digital Memory in as little as 5 minutes. \n\n        1) After you sign up, we\u2019ll ask you a few questions about your loved one. (Don\u2019t worry, your \n        data will not be used or shared outside of the Digital Memory) \n\n        2) Add photos, videos, or a soundtrack to enhance your Memory and select a template to \n        display it. \n\n        3) You can then select items from our registry or create your own cash funds to \n        meaningfully commemorate your loved one. \n        \n        4) Click Publish & Share. We\u2019ll provide a URL that you can share with family and friends. \n        They can easily add memories, photos, videos, and articles, as well as contribute to \n        something you\u2019ve selected in the registry."}]}}]);
