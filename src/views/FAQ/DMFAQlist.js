        answer: `As the Digital Memory creator, you will have the option to enable approvals of contributor
        posts. This will allow you to approve every post before it appears publicly on your Digital
        Memory.

        If you don’t select this option initially, you can always turn it on later. You can also delete
        individual posts that have already been published.`
