        question: "What is RestEasy?",
        answer: `We know how it feels to lose someone. In times of grieving, we try to make things a little easier. 
        
        RestEasy provides those who have recently lost loved ones with a meaningful and 
        personalized way to commemorate them. Our Digital Memory product lets you create and 
        customize a digital memorial with photos, videos, articles, music, and memories that 
        celebrate the life of your loved one. Publish and share with family and friends so they can 
        contribute additional memories. 

        Our Registry feature allows you to register for items that would help you cope with the 
        grief and memorialize your loved one – in the way they would want to be remembered. 
        Registry items can include products, services, or charitable organizations listed on our site, 
        and if you don’t see what you’re looking for, you can create your own custom cash fund. 
        Those with whom you share the Memory can donate funds to help you attain your registry 
        items.`

        question: "What makes RestEasy different?",
        answer: `Traditionally, condolence messages are captured in a Funeral Guest Book at a funeral service. 
        The book can only be signed by those who physically attend the funeral and can only be read by the 
        person who keeps it after the service. 

        A Digital Memory allows everyone who loved your loved one to contribute not only stories and messages, 
        but photos, live videos, and music. And it can be viewed at any time (birthdays, anniversaries, any 
        Tuesday when you really miss them) by all who love them.
        
        Sharing your Digital Memory allows you to move outside the confines of a traditional obituary when 
        announcing a death. Share more than just facts about their life and death - capture the essence of 
        who they are and the legacy they have left.`

        question: "How does it work?",
        answer: `Create a Digital Memory in as little as 5 minutes. 

        1) After you sign up, we’ll ask you a few questions about your loved one. (Don’t worry, your 
        data will not be used or shared outside of the Digital Memory) 

        2) Add photos, videos, or a soundtrack to enhance your Memory and select a template to 
        display it. 

        3) You can then select items from our registry or create your own cash funds to 
        meaningfully commemorate your loved one. 
        
        4) Click Publish & Share. We’ll provide a URL that you can share with family and friends. 
        They can easily add memories, photos, videos, and articles, as well as contribute to 
        something you’ve selected in the registry.`
